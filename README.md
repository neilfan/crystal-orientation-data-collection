===================================

*THIS IS A MIRROR OF PROJECT HOSTED ON GOOGLE CODE https://code.google.com/p/crystal-orientation-data-collection/*

The Federal Government, via the Australian National Data Service (ANDS), has funded the creation and development of the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) infrastructure, supporting the discovery of, and access to, research data held in Australian universities, publicly funded research agencies and government organisations for the use of research. Under this program, funding is available for Data Capture projects which create infrastructure within institutions to collect and manage data, and to improve the way metadata about it is managed.

Deakin University has been awarded funding under the “Data Capture” initiative for the ANDS - Crystal Orientation Data Collection for Conversion to a General Data Type project.
The primary objective of this project is to develop infrastructure within Deakin’s electron microscope facility to support the ongoing data capture and management of metals deformation data and metadata, supporting the discovery, reuse and sharing of this research data by other researchers into the future.

This project will also utilise infrastructure developed by the ANDS - Seeding the Commons project for metadata storage and harvest.
